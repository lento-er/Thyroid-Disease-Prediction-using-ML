This project is a testament to the power of data analysis and machine learning in healthcare. Through a rigorous exploration of clinical data, I deployed a range of machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Logical Regression notably Linear Regression, and Decision Tree Regressor. These models delivered exceptional accuracies of 95% and 96%, respectively, underscoring their proficiency in uncovering complex patterns within the dataset. Such high accuracy is pivotal in healthcare decision-making, where precise predictions can significantly impact patient outcomes. These results lay the foundation for the application of machine learning in clinical settings, with the potential to revolutionize medical decision support and patient care.
